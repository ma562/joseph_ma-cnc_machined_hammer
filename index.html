					The G-code was generated on Vericut which is a software program used to perform simulations for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining. The code was initially written on a .txt file on Notepad which was then uploaded into the Vericut program. 
					<br><br><br>
					The final CNC operation was done on the Hurco CNC machine and hammer head.<br>
					The engraving was done over an area of 2.5 * 0.6inches.<br><br><br>
