					The G-code was generated on Vericut which is a software program used to perform simulations for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining. The code was initially written on a .txt file on Notepad which was then uploaded into the Vericut program. 
					<br><br><br>
					The final CNC operation was done on the Hurco CNC machine and hammer head.<br>
					The engraving was done over an area of 2.5 * 0.6inches.<br><br><br>

					<b>Toolpaths Design</b><br><br>
					Linear patterns in the design included the letter A. If you observe the Avengers logo, you'll notice that the outer line seems to have a slighlty less steep slope than that of the inner line.<br><br>

					From the code:<br>
					“G00 Z.1				(Main letter)<br>
					 <b>X.42 Y.64</b><br>
					 G01 Z-.004 F2.<br>
					 <b>X.25 Y.05</b> F11.<br>
					 <b>X.35</b> <br>
					 <b>X.40 Y.25</b>”<br><br>

					 The slope of the outer line was (0.64-0.05)/(0.42-0.25) = 3.47 inches rise for every inch run
					 On the other hand, the slope of the inner line was (0.25-0.05)/(0.4-0.35) = 4 inches rise for every inch run.<br><br>
					 One of the more complicated parts were the round corners. The change in y must be equivalent to the change in x since the code for radial arc represents part of a circle (not an oval or ellipse).
					 For example in the code written for letter ‘R’:
					 <br><br>
					 “(Letter R)<br>
					  G00 Z.1<br>
					  X1.93<br>
					  G01 Z-.004 F2.<br>
					  X2.03 <b>Y.53</b> F11.<br>
					  <b>X2.18</b><br>
					  <b>G02 X2.23 Y.48 R0.05 </b>F11.<br>
					  G01 Z-.004 F2.<br>
					  X2.2 Y.36 F11.”<br><br>

					  With the initial point before the first round corner (top right) of letter R being at points (2.18, 0.53), I needed to ensure that the final points after the arc was reasonable which was found by trial and error. By increasing/ decreasing the radius, I was able to finalize and come up with a radius of 0.05. 
					  Since I was making part of a circle and not a full circle, the change in X and Y just needs to be equal to the radius.<br><br>
					  From the code above, we could see the change in Y: |0.53-0.48| = 0.05<br>
					  And the change in X: |2.18-2.23| = 0.05.
